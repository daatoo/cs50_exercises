## Problem Sets

### C
- `hello`: A program that greets the user.
- `mario-less`: A program that prints out a half-pyramid of a specified height.
- `cash`: A greedy algorithm that calculates the least amount of coins required to give a user change.
- `caesar`: Implements a cipher that encrypts messages by rotating each letter by a specified number of places.
- `volume`: A program that modifies audio files by increasing or decreasing their volume.

### Arrays
- `dna`: A program that identifies a person based on their DNA.
- `readability`: Evaluates the reading level of a text.
- `substitution`: A cipher that encrypts messages by substituting each letter with another letter.

### Algorithms
- `sort`: Implements several sorting algorithms.
- `plurality`: Simulates a plurality vote election.
- `runoff`: Simulates a runoff vote election.

### Memory
- `filter-less`: Applies grayscale, sepia, reflection, or blur filters to BMPs without using additional memory.
- `recover`: Recovers JPEGs from a forensic image.

### Data Structures
- `movies`: A program that runs SQL queries on a database of movies.
- `population`: A program that performs data import and queries on a population database.

### Python
- `sentimental-hello`: A Python version of the "hello" program.
- `sentimental-cash`: A Python version of the "cash" program.
- `sentimental-mario-more`: A Python version of the "mario" program.
- `sentimental-readability`: A Python version of the "readability" program.

### SQL
- `finance`: A web app for managing portfolios of stocks.
- `birthdays`: A program that keeps track of friends' birthdays.

### HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- `homepage`: A simple homepage that includes a greeting, a bio, and links to social media profiles.

### Flask
- `fiftyville`: A program that helps solve crimes through SQL queries.

### Final Project
- `project`: My final project for CS50x, which is a culmination of everything I've learned throughout the course.

## How to Use
To run these programs, you will need to follow the instructions specific to each problem set's language and environment. For C programs, you can compile them with `clang`. For Python scripts, you can run them with the Python interpreter. Web-based projects can be viewed by opening the HTML files in a browser or setting up a local server for dynamic content.

## Reflection
Completing these exercises has been a monumental step in my journey to understanding computer science and programming. The course has taught me not only the syntax of different programming languages but also the thought process behind designing algorithms and developing efficient code.

## Acknowledgements
I would like to express my gratitude to the instructors and staff of Harvard's CS50x course for providing a well-structured and challenging learning experience.
