# Harvard CS50x Course Exercises

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises from the Harvard CS50x course. CS50x is an entry-level course to computer science, covering concepts such as algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development.

## Exercises

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a problem set from the CS50x course. Inside each folder, you will find the exercise solutions along with a brief description.

### Problem Set 1: C
- `hello.c`: Program that prints out a simple greeting to the user.
- `mario.c`: Program that recreates the half-pyramid using hashes (`#`) for blocks.
- `cash.c`: Program that calculates the minimum number of coins required to give a user change.

### Problem Set 2: Arrays
- `readability.c`: Program that computes the approximate grade level needed to comprehend some text.
- `substitution.c`: Program that implements a substitution cipher.


## How to Use

To run these programs, you will need to clone the repository and then compile the C files using `clang` or another C compiler. For web-based projects, you may simply open the HTML files in a web browser.
